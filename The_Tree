7 miles away from Johnson's home, there was a tree.
A acorn tree, to be exact.
But not just **any** acorn tree.
Among the villagers, the tree was believed to be cursed, destinied to bring downfall to whoever dared to cross its path.
However, Johnson was not afraid.
"Just old superstitions," he scoffed, "I'm going to go to that tree for an adventure the next day."
He tried to find a travelling buddy among his many friends, but they all refused.
Therefore, he went alone the next day, trekking through the barren earth.
Before long, the tree came to sight.
He reached his riding boot forward and kicked the roots of the tree.
Hard.
As if to attempt a counterattack, a tendril of smoke snaked out of the tree and shot towards him.
But Johnson laughed at the tree's feeble attempt, and went on his way.
Not long after, the effects began to set in.
