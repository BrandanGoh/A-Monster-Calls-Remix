The night was cold, drafts blowing through the thin windows.
Outside, at the graveyard, the old, clock tower that was never replaced struck twelve.
Inside the house, Mr Johnson sat on his patched-up sofa.
He was oblivious to the dark shadow moving silently outside.
The silhouette sweeped across the tombs.
Holding something to his mouth, he blew soundlessly.
A flash of silver shot out of the object, hitting the back of Mr Johnson's neck.
A cry of pain rang out through the night, as Mr Johnson thudded to the floor.
Pulling back on his cloak, the mysterious figure disappeared into the darkness.
