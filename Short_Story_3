7 miles away from Johnson's home, there was a tree.
A acorn tree, to be exact.
But not just **any** acorn tree.
Among the villagers, the tree was believed to be cursed, destinied to bring downfall to whoever dared to cross its path.
However, Johnson was not afraid.
"Just old superstitions," he scoffed, "I'm going to go to that tree for an adventure the next day."
He tried to find a travelling buddy among his many friends, but they all refused.
Therefore, he went alone the next day, trekking through the barren earth.
Before long, the tree came to sight.
As he approached the tree, a tendril of smoke and ash started snaking towards him.
Ignoring the tendril, he attempted to kick it away with his riding boot.
But the tendril grabbed his leg instead.
No longer the once unafraid teenager that had first came, he started to feel scared.
Kicking, he tried unsuccessfully to wrestle the tendril away.
In response to his actions, more tendrils started seeping out from the tree, reaching out for his limbs, pinning him to the ground.
His screams reached no one.
He was too far away from civilisation.
A hole opened from the grooves of the trunk, and from it sprouted tongues of fire.
Johnson howled in pain, as the tree burnt and destroyed him alive.
And all was silent once more.
