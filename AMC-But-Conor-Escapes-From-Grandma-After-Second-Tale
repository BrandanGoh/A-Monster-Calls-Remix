"What have you done?" Conor yelled out to the air, as if believing by doing so, he would get answers.
But no answers came.
Snapping out, he realised that he had to act quickly.
Once his grandma's car pulled into the driveway, all would be lost.
Taking advantage of the precious time he had, Conor packed whatever he might need into his rucksack.
Creeping out, Conor started running, enveloped under a shroud of darkness.
He could see lights from his grandma's house, screams and shouts, but he didn't dare look back.
Running faster than he had ever done before, Conor burst into his house, the one with the yew tree.
Continuing his frenzied packing, Conor ran out and away before anyone was the wiser.
