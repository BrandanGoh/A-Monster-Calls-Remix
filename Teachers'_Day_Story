For the past few years, there have been everyday heroes, silently supporting us throughout our lives.
We never actually get a chance to show all our gratitude, before they fade into the vast expanse of humanity.
Those people are our teachers.
Doesn't our learning journey just pass so fast?
There's the PSLE, O-Levels, A-Levels, then university.
And then suddenly, you're leaving your beloved school behind, heading out into the unknown.
Reflecting on my own learning experience, the time really has flown.
And through this experience, there have been our unsung heroes, teachers.
They support us when we need it the most, and also give very good advice.
Teachers are a tower of strength.
They seem to know everything, like a walking, living dictionary. 
And don't you think, that appreciation, true gratitude, is only shown on graduation day?
After that day, we rarely see them anymore.
Saddening.
All too soon, they are gone.
Forever.
We take teachers for granted.
But they are the ones that supply us with knowledge, to grow the world.
To make the world a better place.
Teachers are truly one of a kind.
Teachers literally make occupations.
Without teachers, there would be no doctors, no nurses, no civil servants, to protect our country, to serve, to lead us.
And not only that, teachers work tirelessly for us.
They mark endless pieces of work.
They prioritise our learning over anything else.
They are caring people.
They help us grow as a person.
This is why I want to wish all teachers out there, a Happy Teachers' Day.
Thank you for everything.

A teacher takes a hand,
opens a mind,
and touches a heart.
